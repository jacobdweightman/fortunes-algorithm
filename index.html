      <p>
        The running of Fortune's algorithm is visualized below. Press any key
        to advance the algorithm one step. On any particular step, one of two
        things will happen: either a site will be added to the beach line, or
        a vertex/edge will be added to the voronoi diagram. Visually, You will
        see the beach line (the piecewise red curve) move from the top to the
        bottom of the screen as the algorithm runs, and the voronoi edges (black
        line segments behind the beach line) appearing as the Voronoi diagram is
        constructed. In the last step, the infinite edges at the edge of the
        diagram are added in.
